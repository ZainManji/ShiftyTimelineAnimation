# ShiftyTimelineAnimation [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ZainManji/ShiftyTimelineAnimation.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/ZainManji/ShiftyTimelineAnimation)

Lightweight Timeline and Dom Tweenable library on top of [Shifty](https://github.com/jeremyckahn/shifty).

## API

To come


## Testing

Install [Node](http://nodejs.org) (comes with npm) and Bower (`npm install -g bower`).

From the repo root, install the project's development dependencies:

```
npm install
bower install
```

Testing relies on the Karma test-runner. If you'd like to use Karma to
automatically watch and re-run the test file during development, it's easiest
to globally install Karma and run it from the CLI.

```
npm install -g karma-cli
karma start
```

To run the tests in Firefox, just once, as CI would:

```
npm test
```
